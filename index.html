<!--I'm Chinese, from Chengdu in the People's Republic. I married Jon Valentine in 1997 in Helsinki. I was in Finland doing a Master's degree (in Finnish!!!), when I met Jon. He's English. He said Valentine is a Scottish-Jewish name, but he's from Yorkshire. He talks rubbish... :)

I am full-time LINGsCARS business owner and I specialise in supplying new UK Contract Hire, (and sometimes PCP, Lease cars and Lease Hire) cars and vans. LINGsCARS consumes my life to make it a very successful business. In 2008, I moved over £35,000,000 of brand new cars!

Oh, I use many large motor supply companies, and I make them compete for my business. You see, they know that they get pre-screened, computer generated information that enables them to do their jobs so quickly and easily that they seem willing to pass more of their savings on to me. It's amazing that many companies in this business still work with illegible, handwritten, incomplete and incorrect information on paper forms and they pass this amongst themselves until they have generated no end of problems. My system is as perfect and as simple as I can make it, and I seem to reap the rewards. My customers get the savings I make passed on to them. I often make my money out of bulk business bonuses that mean that I don't need to make 1p on the cost price of a car. So simple, but so hard for other firms, it seems. Am I giving away my secrets? I'd better stop...
